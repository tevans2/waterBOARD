## Overview

waterBOARD is a Windows-based application written in Delphi that allows users to track the capacity of the 6 major dams supplying water to Cape Town. It provides 10 years of historical data on the dams and fetches the most recent data from the City of Cape Town's website every time the application runs. Additionally, waterBOARD enables users to monitor and manage their personal water usage by inputting their monthly readings and setting usage goals to promote water conservation.

## Features

- Dam Capacity Tracking: View the capacity levels of the 6 major dams with up-to-date data fetched from the City of Cape Town's website and over 10 years of historical data.

- Personal Water Usage Tracking: Input your monthly water usage readings, either directly in the application or by uploading a text file with multiple months' readings (format: '##,## - yyyy/mm/dd').

- Usage Goal Setting: Set monthly water usage goals to help monitor and reduce water consumption.

- User Authentication: Securely sign in with a username and password to access personalized water usage data.
